## About
DSGos is an experiment from some of the [DSG](http://dsg.teiste.gr/) members. It
is an unofficial project and will remain unofficial until we have something
working to present.

DSGos is a Linux Distribution created from scratch. We chose to create such a
distro because we wanted to understand and experience how the heart of a linux
distribution works.

## Purpose & Future
This is an experiment. We do not know if we succeed. And even if we do, we do
not know if we will support the distro. Sustaining a linux distro is extremely
time consuming.

We uploaded it at Github because of the ease of work it provide us. Also it is
very easy for someone to follow our steps by following the development.

The main purpose of this project is obtaining experience but never say never. If
we believe it is worthy for us to make a step forward we will do it.

##License
DSGos is licensed under an MIT License so you are absolutely free to do anything
you want with it. For more info see the LICENSE file.

If you create something from this project, send us an [e-mail](mailto:johnprantalos@gmail.gr).
We will be happy to know about it.
