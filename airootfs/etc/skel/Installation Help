-=Welcome to DSGos based in ArchLinux=-

First you must have internet access to procced with installation:
a)If you can connect with GUI then open a terminal, for Wi-Fi give us
"sudo wifi-menu -o" then select and connect to a hotspot if you give 
wrong password the configuration file is "/var/lib/NetworkManager" find it and 
remove it then try again with correct password.

b)To use update your computer time must be sync with arch server timezone
if you are not sync you can't update. To avoid this "bug" go with su user and 
add "options timeout:1" in file: "/etc/resolv.config"
eg:
# Generated by resolvconf
nameserver 192.168.1.1
options timeout:1

Save it

c)Now your are ready to start package installation to do this simple run with
terminal this command: ~/InstallPackages and wait to be completed!

d)To start up all services give the command: ~/StartUpServices and reboot
